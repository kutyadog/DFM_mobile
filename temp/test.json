Dan Pabon, D-Denver, the sponsor of the bill, opened testimony by issuing an amendment to the bill that would only require Class 1 misdemeanor convictions require a DNA submission. Pabon originally had sought to require convictions of Class 1, Class 2 and Class 3 misdemeanors be required to submit DNA samples. </p><p>\"This will help solve crimes and exonerate the innocent,\" said Pabon Thursday, comparing DNA to fingerprinting and mugshots. </p><p>State Rep. Jared Wright, R-Fruita, argued to Pabon there's 36 pages of Class 1 misdemeanors in Colorado that include relatively minor offenses and that DNA collection is a serious process. </p><p> \"DNA  is an inventory of everything in the home — fingerprint is just address to the home,\" Wright said. </p><p>Misdemeanors in Colorado include everything from domestic violence assaults to barbering without a license and tampering with election machinery. Upon convictions of these crimes,under the legislation, an individual would have pay a $128 fee for their DNA sample to be taken. </p><p>Pabon has stressed that by gathering DNA samples for misdemeanor crimes more violent felonies will be solved.  </p><p>But Rep. Claire Levy, D-Boulder, questioned the premise  of the bill. </p><p>\"So you're saying by committing a property offense, it's likely you'll commit more violent crimes,\"  Levy said. </p><p>Pabon said the reason his bill calls for DNA samples for all misdemeanors is for uniformity purposes. </p><p>\"It's for officers and court officials in collection of DNA,\" Pabon said. \"This gives some consistency to court officials to know what requires a DNA sample.\" </p><p>Already in Colorado those charged with a  felony or misdemeanor sexual misconduct  must submit a DNA sample. </p><p>The House Judiciary committee consists of seven Democrats and four Republicans who are expected to cast a vote on the measure Thursday afternoon. </p><p><i>Kurtis Lee: 303-954-1655, <a href='mailto:klee@denverpost.com'>klee@denverpost.com</a> or <a href='http://twitter.com/kurtisalee'>twitter.com/kurtisalee</a></i></p>"

              "#cdata-section": "<p>After excoriating Adams County social services for its botched effort to protect the child, a judge on Thursday sentenced Donald  Scarlett to 42 years in prison for beating a toddler to death.</p><p>Scarlett, 33, had initially been charged with murder for killing 22-month-old Michael Ryan Harris, but a jury found him guilty of child abuse resulting in death. He faced up to 48 years in prison.</p><p>Michael, who died Feb. 2, 2011,  was one of 72 children who died between 2007 and 2012 after child welfare officials had been alerted that they were being abused or neglected, the Denver Post and 9News reported in a 2012 series. Michael was one of the children profiled in that series, <a href=\"http://childfatalities.denverpost.com/#id=23&name=HarrisMichael\" title=\"Failed to Death\" target=\"_blank\"> <a href=\"http://childfatalities.denverpost.com/#id=23&name=HarrisMichael\" title=\"one of the children profiled\" target=\"_blank\"> Failed to Death, </a></a>last October.</p><p>Before handing down the sentence, Judge Chris Melonakis lashed out at Adams County Department of Human Services, which he said had returned Michael and his 3-year-old brother to their mother just weeks before Michael's death, then neglected to make sure the boys were safe.</p><p>Melonakis called the county's performance \"extreme malfeasance,\" and said they had received reports three days before Michael's death that his  older brother had a \"suspicious\" injury. Nevertheless, social workers never took that child to a doctor, and didn't examine Michael for injuries at all.</p><p>\"This child was literally failed to death,\" Melonakis said.</p><p>  \"Frankly, I think somebody should take (social workers) in front of a grand jury and find out whether their conduct was criminal.\"</p><p>When Michael was 1-year-old, social workers took him and his two older brothers from their mother, Rosanna Key. The oldest of the boys went to live with his father. Michael and his older brother went to foster care.</p><p>Key admitted smoking marijuana and said her parents and roommate — who often cared for the children — also smoked marijuana and methamphetamine, according to a state Department of Human Services review.</p><p>The two youngest children, including Michael, were returned to Key  four months later, after she completed parenting and substance abuse courses. By that time,  she was living with Scarlett.</p><p>Scarlett's attorney, Harvey Steinberg, also laid blame for the little boy's death at the feet of Adams County social workers. Steinberg, who may be best known for representing professional athletes and high-profile defendants, argued that Scarlett had no prior criminal record and a stable work history. </p><p>Scarlett's mother, Lori Ramirez,  pleaded for a lenient sentence for her son, whom she called \"a loving caring man.\" </p><p>But Melonakis said it  was Scarlett whom a jury convicted of raining down blows so violent they severed Michael's pancreas. The force of the beating ruptured nerve endings in Michael's spine and caused his heart and lungs to stop functioning, the judge said.</p><p>After Michael's death, his mother told investigators that she and Scarlett fought over Michael's crying. Once, Scarlett accused Key of \"babying\"  the 22-month-old.</p><p>Key told authorities she heard her son crying — screaming — from behind a door while Scarlett beat him the night before he died. She said she never opened the door and didn't check on her son all night and left him alone with Scarlett the next morning when she went to work.</p><p>Key is serving 16 years in prison for her role in her son's death.</p><p>On Thursday, Melonakis, who also imposed that sentence, said he would have given Key a longer prison term if the law had allowed.</p><p>\"Michael Harris never had a chance in life,\" Melonakis said.</p><p>His mother failed him, and the agency charged with protecting him \"demonstrated an appalling level of neglect,\" and now will \"hide behind privacy laws\" that might shed light on that negligence, the judge said.</p><p>\"Children die and bureaucrats still have their jobs,\" he said.</p><p>When Melonakis announced Scarlett's 42-year-sentence, his mother broke down, sobbing. No members of Michael Harris' family were in the courtroom.</p><p><i>Karen Aug&eacute;: 303-954-1733, kauge@denverpost.com or twitter.com/karenauge</i></p>"

More than 60 buildings, old and new, put out the welcome mat for the public over the weekend, and it's all free. In addition, there are scores of expert-guided tours offered at no cost.</p><p>But it can be a lot of work to sort out the list of sites. Do you want to see historic structures or modern rehabs? Do you want to stick to a single neighborhood or cover some geography?</p><p>This year's theme is \"City Beautiful Then & Now,\" harking back to the early 20th-century movement to create elegant, expansive architecture in urban areas. \r\n</p><p> The list includes older, ornate structures around <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/art/ci_4881622\" title=\"www.denverpost.com\"> Civic Center</a>, like the just-refurbished  <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/entertainment/ci_21951418/nbsp-nbsp-mcnichols-buildings-artful-reopening\">McNichols Building</a>, plus  scattered landmarks, like the Zen Center of Denver, at 3101 W. 31st Ave., as good an example of classical revivalism as you'll see in the West. </p><p>But there are also recent  structures built to serve a civic purpose with the same spirit.</p><p> You can get into the first floor of the  <a href=\"http://blogs.denverpost.com/artmosphere/category/clyfford-still-museum/\">Clyfford Still Museum </a>at 13th and Bannock streets, or see the new Denver Crime Lab, at West 14th Avenue and  Cherokee Street,  one of the guided tours. \"These are the buildings that will be the landmarks of the future,\" said Annie Levinsky, executive director of  <a href=\"http://www.historicdenver.org/\">Historic Denver</a>, a partner in the event.</p><p>Check out the  list  on the website, <a href=\"http://denverarchitecture.org/resources/newsletter/doors-open-denver-2013\" title=\"denverarchitecture.org\">denverarchitecture.org</a>, and match it to your  taste for exploring. Here's   advice if you are willing to dig  deeper into the  possibilities.  </p><p><b>1.</b> Look for deals. Like getting a free tour of the  <a href=\"http://www.mollybrown.org/\">Molly Brown House</a>, which usually charges $8 a person. The 1889 Queen Anne mansion will be open both Saturday and Sunday as part of the guided tour offerings.</p><p><b>2.</b> Look for opportunities. Like seeing the fascinating  <a href=\"http://www.dikeoucollection.org/\">Dikeou Collection </a>of art in the Colorado Building on an actual weekend. The contemporary museum, at 1615 California St.,  is one of Denver's best-kept cultural secrets due to its limited, weekday hours.</p><p><b>3.</b> Look for specials. Like the one offered by the Denver Animal Shelter, which is cutting adoption prices in half    to capitalize on the crowds. The shelter, at 1241 W. Bayaud Ave., is so deluxe you might feel guilty bringing a pet home to your  own ordinary house.</p><p><b>4. </b>Look for line-cutting opportunities. Like the V.I.P. pass. Many of Doors Open Denver's organized tours   fill quickly, and you have to register for them in person. That means showing up at the McNichols Building headquarters at 8:30 a.m. to claim your place, even if your tour doesn't start for hours. </p><p>But you can also buy a V.I.P. pass, which will allow you to score a spot in advance. They cost $100, though the money supports the event's operating expenses.

Lisanne Leasure, an attorney for Kortz in a negligence suit over one of the kidney patients, said in a statement that Kortz's care was \"reasonable and appropriate.\"</p><p>\"Dr. Kortz is a very experienced and excellent surgeon who has helped many Coloradans over his lengthy career,\" Leasure said in the statement with co-counsel Bruce Montoya. The patient's attorney in the malpractice case \"is seeking to use the Board matter to gain advantage or force a settlement in the civil case,\" they said. \"These tactics are, in our view, inappropriate and will prove to be unsuccessful.\"</p><p>State investigators are asking an administrative judge to \"discipline\"  Kortz's license to practice medicine, although they did not elaborate on what punishment they will pursue. Kortz is still featured prominently in Porter's publicity for its robotic surgery and transplant departments.</p><p>\"I'd really like to see that this never happens again. It never should have,\" said Shanti Lechuga, a patient suing Kortz for negligence.</p><p>The formal complaint comes as federal officials  seek more information on  <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-204_162-57578598/fda-eyes-increase-in-freak-accidents-during-robotic-surgeries/\" title=\"Link to national article on robotic surgery issues\" target=\"_blank\">robotic surgery results and mistakes around the nation</a>.</p><p> The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it is stepping up interviews of surgeons about the devices after a new series of mishap reports, although the agency said it has not yet identified a trend. Hospitals spend more than $1 million on each of the da Vinci-brand surgery units and are under pressure to keep them busy.</p><p>\"Since it is difficult to know why the reports have increased, the FDA has elected to talk with surgeons to better understand the factors that may be contributing to the rise in report numbers,\" FDA spokeswoman Synim Rivers said in a statement.</p><p>Porter suspended Kortz's robotic-surgery privileges for three months in 2010 and reported to the medical board that he had complications with 11 surgeries using a hospital robot, according to the state complaint. </p><p>Kortz used the robot for complex kidney donor removals in 2008, 2009 and 2010, when using it was not the \"standard of care\" for such procedures, the state said. Many of those procedures went bad and had to be converted on the fly to open surgeries to fix problems, according to the complaint and the malpractice lawsuit.</p><p>The Denver hospital would not say whether it required new training for Kortz before restoring his privileges after the 2010 suspension. \"Under Colorado law, the physician peer-review process is confidential and we are not at liberty to comment on individual cases,\" hospital spokesman Tim Shonsey  said in a statement.</p><p>Kortz is on the Porter medical staff but is not an employee, Shonsey said. Porter, part of the Centura group of hospitals, currently advertises a  relationship with Kortz for both transplants and robotic procedures. Porter undertakes a rigorous review \"anytime there is a clinical quality concern,\" the statement said. </p><p>The state  medical board complaint, filed by the Attorney General, details 11 patient cases  allegedly mishandled by Kortz. The cases include:</p><p> • \"S.L.,\" a 22-year-old woman  who wanted to donate a kidney to her ailing brother. (Patients are identified only by initials in the state complaint.) The state said Kortz  told S.L. that the robot was the \"gold standard\" for kidney removal and transplant, neglecting to say it did not have a long-term track record in such cases, or that open or laparoscopic surgery were also options. </p><p>During surgery, Kortz immediately injured S.L.'s aorta when first inserting a \"trocar,\" or pathway device allowing access to the abdomen. Kortz converted to an open surgery to stop the bleeding, then aborted the kidney removal and closed up. S.L. went into post-operative respiratory distress, and an X-ray found a sponge had been left inside her.</p><p>Kortz also improperly padded S.L. on the table, leading to nerve damage during the surgery, and S.L.  \"was not the first patient\" of Kortz's to suffer such an injury, the state said.</p><p>Lechuga  said she is the patient listed as S.L.; she is named fully in her malpractice lawsuit against Kortz and a radiologist on the case, Dr. Keith Dangleis. Her brother, Christopher, was waiting at Porter to receive her kidney once Kortz removed it, the lawsuit claims. When the transplant had to be aborted, Christopher waited another six months on dialysis before getting a different donor, the lawsuit said.</p><p>Lechuga said she was told soon after the operation that hers was the only such complication. Now that she has read the state's charges, she said, \"it blew my mind there were so many before me, and so many who had aorta injuries, too.\" </p><p>Kortz's attorney, Leasure, said the Lechuga case complications had nothing to do with robotics. Lechuga was advised before the surgery of the possible risks, and consented, Leasure's statement said. </p><p> • \"J.S.,\"  an 86-year-old with metastatic cancer,  with whom Kortz allegedly used a robot when the standard of care in such cases was open surgery. Kortz injured the aorta, then when converting to open surgery as an emergency, the robot arm moved when it shouldn't have, causing another tear, the complaint said.</p><p>J.S. suffered kidney failure after the operation, and the family withdrew life support \"shortly after the surgery,\" the state complaint said.</p><p> •  \"E.W.,\" a  26-year-old female hoping to donate her left kidney. A previous CT scan showed kidney stones developing in the remaining right kidney, and Kortz should have discussed and documented the dangers of retaining only one compromised kidney, the complaint said.</p><p>During the kidney removal, one of E.W.'s veins started bleeding; while working on that, Kortz allegedly injured an aorta with a scalpel held by the robot. E.W. lost blood pressure and had to be resuscitated. The robotic surgery was converted to an open surgery, and harvest of the organ was aborted.</p><p>Transplant centers are under tight scrutiny from regulators and accrediting groups as more hospitals advertise expertise in the complex procedures. Losing a potential donor organ is a blow, as waiting lists for kidneys are years long.</p><p>The 11 cases cited by the state include two where a sponge or another instrument was left inside patients, who then had to be reopened to remove the piece; and two cases where Kortz allegedly used an artery clip that the manufacturer had said years before should not be used in similar surgeries.</p><p>State officials said that in May, a date will be set for a hearing of the medical board complaints before a judge. </p><p><i>Michael Booth: 303-954-1686, mbooth@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mboothdp</i></p>"

Dan Pabon, a Denver Democrat, who is the sponsor of the legislation that's set to be heard  before a House committee Thursday. \" We have become so sophisticated in our technology and science, we can without a shadow of a doubt link someone physically to a crime.\" </p><p>Already in Colorado, individuals arrested on a felony charge  and some misdemeanors involving unlawful sexual conduct are required to provide the state with a DNA sample. And those convicted of a misdemeanor under the proposed legislation would have to pay a $128 fee  to cover the costs of the sample. </p><p>Late Wednesday afternoon, after The Denver Post reported about Pabon's bill online, the sponsor said he would offer an amendment to the measure that would only require Class 1 misdemeanors be swabbed. </p><p>However,  though Pabon is targeting most misdemeanor offenses, his legislation does not require those convicted of misdemeanor traffic offenses — such as DUIs —  to submit oral samples. </p><p>\"We don't have the statistics that demonstrate just because you're drinking and driving that you have a propensity to commit more serious crimes,\" Pabon said. \"With respect to theft crimes, assault crimes, those involving the objectification of a person ... those types of crimes indicate that you're going to commit more serious crimes.\" </p><p>Denise Maes, public policy director at the American Civil Liberties  Union of Colorado, said it's a false assumption to conclude that any person who commits a low-level misdemeanor will commit more serious crimes in the future. </p><p>\"This encroaches on an individual's privacy,\" said Maes, who will offer testimony on Thursday in opposition to the bill.  \"Further, listen carefully to the rationale supporting this bill: 'Collecting DNA helps solve crime.' There is no end to this mission.

Officials said he will be held at a different detention facility.</p><p>Major Crimes Cmdr. Ronald Saunier called the arrest \"a great relief to us\" but said detectives have many unanswered questions, including whether others assisted in Trujillo's escape. </p><p>Denver police late Tuesday arrested Marilyn Annette Reeves, 47, on suspicion that she helped Trujillo, though officials would not describe her role in the case. </p><p>Police had surrounded her apartment in Thornton at least once this week.</p><p>Also facing felony charges is Denver Sheriff's deputy Matthew Andrews, 36, who police sources have said helped Trujillo walk out of the jail about 7 p.m. Sunday and drove him to Thornton before returning to the jail, where he worked in general security.</p><p>\"We continue to review our policies, procedures and training to make sure this problem will never happen again,\" Denver Undersheriff Gary Wilson said at a news conference. He added that he was \"very disturbed by this issue.\"</p><p>He did not take reporters' questions, and officials have offered few details about the escape.
